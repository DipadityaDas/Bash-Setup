## What is ANSI?

[*ANSI*](https://ansi.org/) stands for the [__American National Standards Institute__](https://ansi.org/). It is a private, non-profit organization that oversees the development of voluntary consensus standards for products, services, processes, systems, and personnel in the United States. Founded in 1918, ANSI serves as a coordinator and facilitator for standardization efforts, working with various industries, government agencies, and consumer groups.

ANSI's __primary role__ is to:

1. Accredit standards developers and facilitate the development of American National Standards (ANS).
2. Represent the United States in international standardization efforts, such as those led by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).
3. Approve national standards and ensure their consistency with international standards when possible.
4. Promote the use of American National Standards by both the public and private sectors.
